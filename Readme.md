# 🌟 Rathna's FOSS Infrastructure Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Rathna — a self-driven IT Infra Engineer passionate about Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). I specialize in building full-stack IT infrastructure for organizations from scratch — including network, cloud, automation, security, monitoring, licensing, and community management — all without relying on proprietary tools.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 💻 Full org infra setup (AD, DNS, DHCP, WSUS, policies)
- 🧩 FOSS tools integration: GLPI, GitLab CE, Zabbix, Wazuh, Jenkins, etc.
- 📦 Virtualization & containerization: Proxmox, Docker
- ☁️ Hybrid cloud: AWS, Azure, self-hosted cloud
- 🎨 UI/UX & media tools: Figma, Penpot, DaVinci Resolve
- 🧠 Infra documentation, automation (YAML, CI/CD)
- 🤝 Community builder, eager to collaborate across domains

## 🛠️ Key Projects

| Project        | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `project-glpi` | Full support desk solution with asset lifecycle mgmt |
| `project-zabbix` | Central monitoring with Grafana visualization |
| `project-jenkins` | CI/CD automation for Angular/React |
| `project-proxmox` | Proxmox VE deployment for private cloud infra |
| `project-gitlabce` | GitLab CE on-prem setup with pipelines |

## 🎯 Vision

I'm building a FOSS-focused community for real-world infra learners who:
- Want to contribute without coding
- Believe in sharing infra knowledge
- Want to build hands-on IT portfolios
